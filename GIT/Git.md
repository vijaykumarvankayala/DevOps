git pull origin main

```

---

### **4. Branching and Merging**

### **git branch**

Manages branches in the repository.

```bash

# List all branches
git branch

# Create a new branch
git branch new_feature

# Switch to a branch
git checkout new_feature

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new_feature

```

### **git merge**

Merges one branch into the current branch.

```bash
# Merge the 'new_feature' branch into the current branch
git merge new_feature

```

### **git checkout**

Switches branches or restores files.

```bash

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout main

# Restore a file to its last committed state
git checkout -- file_name.txt

```

### **git rebase**

Reapplies commits on top of another base branch (linear history).

```bash

# Rebase your feature branch onto the main branch
git checkout new_feature
git rebase main

```

---

### **5. Undoing Changes**

### **git reset**

Resets your working directory to a previous commit or state.

```bash

# Unstage changes but keep the changes in your working directory
git reset HEAD file_name.txt

# Reset to a previous commit (hard reset will lose changes)
git reset --hard commit_hash

```

### **git revert**

Creates a new commit that reverses the changes from a previous commit.

```bash

# Revert a specific commit
git revert commit_hash

```

---

### **Common Workflows**

### **Creating a new repository**

    ```bash
    
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    
    ```
    
2. Link the remote repository and push:
    
    ```bash
    
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
    git push -u origin main
    
    ```
    

### **Forking a repository and making changes**

1. Fork a repository from GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:
    
    ```bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
    
    ```
    
3. Make changes, commit, and push:
 ```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Made some changes"
git push origin main
    
    ```
